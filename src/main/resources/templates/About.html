<p class="lead">KCG was created by Allen Klare with the purpose of producing the highest quality custom guitars in the world</p>
<br></br>
<h2>Our Work</h2>

<h3>Tonewoods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maple</strong> - Each maple top is hand selected for each custom project.  We look for
        tightness of grain, quality of figure and tap test every piece of maple that comes into our shop.</li>
        <li><strong>Ash</strong> - We focus on northern ash to replicate vintage T and S style guitars.  We have stocks of one piece and
        two piece bodies available on request.</li>
        <li><strong>Mahogany</strong> - All mahogany bodies at KCG are one piece blanks that are selected by grain quality.
        Mahogany is getting more and more difficult to source, so some blanks are made from antique furniture where pieces can be saved.
        This recycling process is good for the native mahogany supply and provides tonewoods that have been naturally dried for extended periods of time.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Finishes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nitrocellulose</strong> - Nitro is the standard KCG finish.  Our guitars are finished with thin clear coats that allow your instrument to breath.
        Our instruments will also gracefully age, so each guitar becomes a living history of its owners.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong> - KCG will finish guitars with tung oil or linseed oil by request.  These finished require more upkeep, but are very durable and provide top-notch playability. </li>
    </ul>
<h3>Pickups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bare Knuckle</strong> - KCG uses Bare Knuckle humbuckers as our standard pickup.  Each set is handwound
        in England and are shipped directly to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Fralin</strong> - KCG uses Lindy Fralin single coils in our T & S style guitars.  Fralins are handwound in the USA.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p class="lead">KCG is committed to guitars that serve the everyday players purpose, while honoring vintage designs.  Our bodies are based off of our own measurements of guitars built in the 50's, 60's and 70's.  All KCG guitars come with a warranty on workmanship for the life of the guitar.</p>
